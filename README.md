# MineSweeper-game-using-Q-Learning


**Project Overview**
Minesweeper is a classic game that challenges players to make decisions under uncertainty and manage risk with limited information. In this project, an AI agent is trained to play Minesweeper by interacting with the game environment, earning rewards for safe actions and incurring penalties when a mine is triggered.

**Project Objectives**

* Implement Reinforcement Learning using Q-learning in a real-game setting
* Use a fixed number of mines with consistent mine placements to support stable training
* Retain the Q-table across levels to allow cumulative learning and performance improvement
* Include a visual, interactive interface to monitor and analyze the AI’s behavior
